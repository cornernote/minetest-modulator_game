How to use the mod:

  its too light.
- The stone monster spawns on stone and is stronger but slower than the
  dirt monster
- The desert monster spawns in deserts and is faster but less strong
  than the dirt monster
- The oerkki is the same as in 0.3. It spawns in realy dark caves and
  is stronger than the dirt monster.
There are also 2 friendly mobs:
- The sheep spawns on grass. You can get wool from it when you rightclick
  it and meat if you kill it. Meat can bee cooked in the furnace to eat it.
- The rat is the same as in 0.3. You can cook it or replace it in the
  world if you catched it with an rightclick.
