Description:
This mod gives an animated texture to water and lava. Each frame moves the texture one pixel for a total of 16 frames. The speed of the flow animation is based on the viscosity of the fluid. It's only 13 lines of code! (plus textures)
It only animates flowing fluid, not a static body of fluid.
