Nature Pack Controller -- 20120730
Vanessa Ezekowitz edition ;-)

This modpack contains my updated flowers, bushes, and irontrees mods.  
Everything else is as it was in Nubelite's "Controlled" fork.

All code/textures herein, including my modifications and rewrites, retain 
whatever licenses the original authors put forth (WTFPL for everything, as far 
as I know)

Installation:

To install this mod pack place the nature_pack_controlled folder inside the 
mods/mintest folder with your other mods.
