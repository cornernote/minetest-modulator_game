DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------

Provides items that will show you how to craft any craftable or cookable item.

It works like this...
build a craft_guide:sign_wall using default:stick shaped like a question mark:
stick stick
stick stick
stick     

(ok, so a question mark isn't perfect in a 3x3)  =)

place the sign, then right click on it... it will open like a chest.

to see the recipe for an item, drop the item into the output slot

you can bookmark items using the block on the right



----------------------------------
SOME ITEMS NOT LOADING?
----------------------------------

If items are not loading then it is probably because craft_guide is loaded after the other items. 

To fix this simply create a depends.txt in the module in question, and add the text "craft_guide".

EG: crafts from default mod are not available - create games/minetest_game/default/depends.txt with this inside:
craft_guide

MY ITEM IS SECRET, HOW CAN I HIDE IT?

In your node definition, set groups={not_in_craft_guide}
