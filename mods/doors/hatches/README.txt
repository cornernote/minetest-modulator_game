Description:
When it's open, a trapdoor is climbable, and you can't go through it when it's closed (the upcoming version of minetest will allow me not to use the whole node as boundary box).
Sorry for the poor textures, feel free to make your own (I'm a terrible artist, although I felt like I had to release that mod with at least one texture).
