Description:

This simple mod uses a bit of code cobbled together from the default torches and from the recently-introduced animated lava to create proper, animated torches.  All existing torches (wall, ceiling, floor) will be displayed with the new animated texture, but no nodes are being replaced.  Inventory/wield image uses the stock torch image already supplied with Minetest.

Textures by VanessaE (derived from a rendered torch and an actual burning flame).
