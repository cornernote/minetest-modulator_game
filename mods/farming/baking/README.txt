To make flour: fill 2x2 square of crafting spaces with wheat.
To make dough: put bucket of water in center and fill the rest of the spaces with flour.
To make bread: put dough in furnace.
Includes a brick oven that will cook food (right now bread and the rat) twice as fast.
To craft it use the brick block in circle like you would to make the normal furnace.
Requires bucket and growing mods!
