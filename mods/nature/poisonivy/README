This is a mod for minetest and its forks to add poison ivy.

Ivy will spawn on dirt or grass, and in some cases, on vertical 
surfaces, trees, and jungle trees where they meet the dirt or grass.  
Ivy previously spawned will occasionally grow taller/thicker or start 
climbing up said vertical surfaces and trees.

At present, the plants present little more than an annoyance - they can 
only be cut down and either re-planted or thrown away.  No damage is 
done by harvesting them, yet. ;-)

Mod based on ironzorg's flowers mod; I left the spawn rates the same so 
the plants don't take over your world (in fact, they may take a few 
day/night cycles before you start to notice them).  If you want a really 
overgrown environment just lower the MAX_RATIO and GROWING_DELAY 
variables at the top of init.lua.

Textures hand-drawn by me (16x16px).
