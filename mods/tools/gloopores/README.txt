Kalite(Red): Can be eaten (restores half a heart) or made into torches. Found below 20y.
Arol(Green): Can be made into tools. Destroys blocks incredibly slowly, but lasts for a very long time. Found below -20y.
Talinite(Teal): Can be made into blocks that glow brightly. Found below -512y!
Akalin(Blue-Violet-ish): Can be made into decorative blocks. Found in desert stone, and as such only found above sea level because desert stone is only found above sea level!
